        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Computing Science graduate that is looking to start there professional career.
            I have learned the foundations of many programming concepts at university such as 
            multiple software development projects, cyber securty fundamentals with aditional courses
            in master level forensics and secured software engineering, database systems and many more.
            While I am open to many career paths my main passion is for web and software development as many
            of my projects are heavily based around these concepts. I am a great teamworker who puts 
            all of my effort into ensuring a high qaulity product is delivered while mainting a healthy
            and fun work environment for my colleagues. Please get in touch using the links above if 
            you have any opportunities you would like me to consider.
        </p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3>4th year final project</h3>
        <p>
            In out final year of university we worked closely with a lecturer to build a system that conformed to 
            their specififcaitons. The aim of my project was to build a system that could sort through emails and pick
            out any that included sensitive informaiton. From this description I built a web app that houses a machin learning algorithm 
            which given an input of an email collection can display all the sensitive and non-sensitive emails, give 
            the identifiers that the algorithm found to flag that specific email as sensitive and also identify the email
            addresses that have sent or recieved a large amount of sensitive emails. This solo project help build 
            confidence in me that I could handle a large scale individual project and be able to produce a 
            professional and functional product. It also allowed me to have a deeper undertsanding of
            machine learning algorithms compared to what I had learned in the course in the previous year, 
            added to my web building skills by introducing java functions, and further developed my time and 
            issue management skills by having to maintain a time log, issue tracker and produce a weekly report 
            that described my progress and any further issues i have identified over the week.
